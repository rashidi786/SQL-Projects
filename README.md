Added my first MySQL project (MySQL project pizza_sales pdf), showcasing queries across basic, intermediate, and advanced levels within the 'pizza' database. This project demonstrates communication between four interconnected tables to extract and analyze meaningful insights. A highlight includes a complex query leveraging the JOIN function twice and the SELECT function thrice, reflecting efficient and advanced query construction for multi-table data handling.
